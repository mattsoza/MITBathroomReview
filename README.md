# MIT Bathroom Review

## Summary
A comedy project I began working on a few years ago. I review bathrooms on the prestigious MIT campus so that you know where the best bathrooms are. Currently deployed on vercel at [MITBathroomReview.com](https://www.mitbathroomreview.com/)

The site is my first time using Svelte, and I tried to minimize the number of packages used. 

## Running locally
All the frontend code for the MIT Bathroom Review is contained here. To run the site locally, run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.
