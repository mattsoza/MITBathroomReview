  <img src="{mirrorSelfie}" alt="A selfie of Matthew taken in an MIT bathroom with three sinks beneath the mirror.">
  <p>
  Almost everywhere you go a bathroom will be available for you to use. Have you ever stopped to wonder why that is? Have you ever taken this modern luxury for granted? Or do you treat it like a given, that your pee and poo will be coddled day and night?<br><br>

  My name is Matthew Soza, and I review bathrooms on the prestigious MIT campus. Through pure serendipity I have had the chance to explore some of the best and worst restrooms at MIT, and sharing their value with fellow peers is my greatest joy. If I help just one person, all of this will have been worth it. “Anything worth doing, hurts a little.” – Mike Rowe of <i>Dirty Jobs</i><br><br>

  When not pissing and pooing, you can find me staring out of windows wistfully, hoping the work I do is meaningful.<br><br>
