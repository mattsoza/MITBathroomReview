  <h1>About us</h1>
  <p>
  Almost everywhere you go a bathroom will be available for you to use. Have you ever stopped to wonder why that is? Have you ever taken this modern luxury for granted? Or do you treat it like a given, that your piss and shit will be coddled day and night?<br><br>

  My name is Matthew Soza, and I review the restrooms on campus. Through pure chance I have had the opportunity to explore some of the best and worst restrooms on campus, and sharing their value with my fellow peers is my greatest joy.
