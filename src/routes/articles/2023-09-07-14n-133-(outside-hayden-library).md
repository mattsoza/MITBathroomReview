Walking into this restroom was nothing short of a miracle.<br><br>

When I found myself deciding whether or not to pick up nature's call, I had been walking out of Hayden Library and toward the Lewis Music Library. I felt that sweet feeling of fullness and satisfaction that can only come from needing to pee, and as I wondered to myself where to go to squeeze the lemons, I found myself suddenly at the door to 14N-133. Never one to shy away from a new pee opportunity, and the VACANT sign being apparent, I entered.<br><br>

To say this bathroom wowed me is an understatement. Cathedral ceilings. Free tampons. A 3 second delay flush. This is a restroom that has it all but still manages to remain humble. Now, on first impressions, I must admit I wasn't thrilled. There was some toilet paper on the floor and a Taco Bell bag tucked behind the sink faucet. I'm not a Michelin Star reviewer though, I'm a bathroom reviewer; I'm not here for ambience, I'm here for the amenities.
