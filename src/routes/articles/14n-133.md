Before I start, I just want to let you know that I wanted to love this restroom. I really did. But it's busted. 


When I found myself deciding whether or not to pick up nature's call, I had been walking out of Hayden Library and toward the Lewis Music Library. I felt that sweet feeling of fullness and satisfaction that precedes a pissing sesh, and as I wondered to myself where to go to squeeze the lemons, I suddenly found myself at the door to 14N-133. I normally don't get nervous like this before peeing, but people kept telling me this restroom was amazing. <i>Is it going to live up to the hype? Will satisfaction touch me?</i> These thoughts swirled in my head like a toilet flush I pushed the bathroom door open.

Now let's get this out of the way early: I was wowed by *some* things. Cathedral ceilings. Free tampons. A 3 second delay on the flush. This is a restroom that has so much to be prideful about. But pride cometh before the fall and I was not thrilled. This place felt... stuffy. I wanted to run, I wanted to cry. All I really had to do here was add a yellow arc to the rainbow of life and I still felt claustrophobic. Something about the high ceilings and small room made it feel like I was in a deep hole and all I needed was a rope. And this was after everyone had told me it was so luxurious. 

Now I'm just nit-picking cause I'm already pissed (no pun intended, but if you laughed, pun intended). There was some toilet paper on the floor and a Taco Bell bag tucked behind the sink faucet. I don't like to comment on cleanliness cause it's no one fault but you, the reader's, but come on. Who door dashed and then left that there?<br><br>

*The aforementioned Taco Bell bag. Unfortunately, there was no food left in the bag :\(*<br><br>

So who is this bathroom for? Not me, and you need to look out for number 1. But more importantly, it's probably for the person who would bring their laptop to a restroom and work there for hours, maybe even take a nap there. There's an outlet nearby for charging, and bringing food doesn't seem like an issue. Hell, bring a date here, I don't care anymore.<br><br>

VERDICT: 2/5 plungers<br><br>

P.P (Post plunger): Here's a gallery of additional photos I think may be important to inform your experience:
