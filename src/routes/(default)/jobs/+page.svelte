    Have you noticed anything strange about MIT Bathroom Review? That's right. <i>It doesn't pass the Bechdel test</i>. You can change that! If you're a woman, you can talk to another woman about a bathroom. If you're a man, you can be one of the men the women don't talk about. Either way, we want <b>you!</b> Democracy Dies in Doo-Doo, and your voice needs to be heard! Here at MIT Bathroom Review, we are all about fostering new points of view, such as my own and the people whom I choose to single-handedly hire. Think you have what it takes? I sure hope so, because frankly I'm really looking for someone to split the cost of this website with. Apply by using the <a href = '/contact'>contact form</a> and telling me some of your qualifications! I don't accept pdf resumes because of the aforementioned cost burden. I don't accept donations because not only do I not need a handout, I'm also not sure of the legal ramifications of doing that.
